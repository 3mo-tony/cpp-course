# C++ Programming Course

Welcome to my C++ programming course! This repository contains all the code examples, exercises, and projects from my C++ learning journey.

## Course Structure

This course is organized into sessions, with each session covering specific C++ concepts and practical examples.

### Session 1: Getting Started with C++

- **Location**: `session-1/`
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Basic C++ syntax and structure
  - Input/Output operations (`cout`, `endl`)
  - Variables and data types (`double`)
  - Comments in C++
  - Basic mathematical operations
  - Program structure and the `main()` function

#### Session 1 Files:

- `main.cpp` - Basic "Hello World" program with variable declarations and calculations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (such as g++, Visual Studio, or MinGW)
- A text editor or IDE (VS Code, Visual Studio, etc.)

### Compiling and Running

To compile and run the programs in this course:

```bash
# Navigate to the session directory
cd session-1

# Compile the C++ file
g++ -o main main.cpp

# Run the executable
./main
```

On Windows:

```cmd
# Navigate to the session directory
cd session-1

# Compile the C++ file
g++ -o main.exe main.cpp

# Run the executable
main.exe
```
